Genetic algorithm in the optimization of the three-dimensional loading space

The aim of this diploma thesis is to present a solution to the problem of loading space using a genetic algorithm. As part of the work, a program was created that minimizes the free space of the hold with using of a genetic algorithm.
The thesis discusses the genetic algorithm by explaining the basic concepts and how it works. The methods of selection, types of coding, crossing and mutation are presented, as well as the special features distinguishing the genetic algorithm from the evolutionary algorithm.
The operation of the program was described and presented by creating a simulation for five sets of packages. On their basis, conclusions were drawn.
